## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project
Project Overview
We will optimize a provided website with a number of optimization- and performance-related issues so that it achieves a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.

Why this project?
As web applications become increasingly interactive and accessed on a variety of devices there are a variety of opportunities in which performance issues can hinder the user experience. This project presents a number of those performance issues and provides an opportunity to showcase your skills in identifying and optimizing web applications.

What will I learn?
I learned about the critical rendering path, the process by which the browser receives HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the required processing to turn them into rendered pixels. Youâ€™ll also start to think of your work as a continuously running web application that requires a consistent framerate to produce the most enjoyable user experience.

#### Part 1: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
